                                <h2>Skills I've Learned</h2>
                                    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Throughout my work in this program, I have learned lots about programming.
                                        I completely learned to program from no prior experience to being 
                                        proficient in Python, C++, Javascript, and HTML. I also have moderate
                                        experience with SQL, NoSQL, and SQLite. I have also learned lots about 
                                        secure coding, best practices, and coding concepts, like Object-Oriented 
                                        Programming. My continued learning has contributed to reinforcement of 
                                        previously learned skills as well as being able to learn more advanced 
                                        concepts</p>

                                    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">In two courses, I learned about the agile approach and lots about the 
                                        Scrum Framework. To reinforce the learning in this course, there were 
                                        group assignments in which we adopted roles in the Scrum Framework, 
                                        learning more about Scrum Master, Project Manager, Stakeholders, and 
                                        Developers. This course also taught me how to effectively communicate 
                                        with Stakeholders and to speak in non-technical terms so they can fully 
                                        understand the work being done.</p>

                                    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">I learned various Data Structures and Algorithms including Binary Search 
                                        Trees, Linked Lists and Vectors. Through this work I learned various 
                                        algorithms like QuickSort, which helped me understand how the structures 
                                        work and the best ways to apply each type of structure. I have learned 
                                        about finding ways to reduce operation time using Big O notation and 
                                        finding the most efficient solution. </p>
                                    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">I have been able to apply all that I have learned to engineer programs 
                                        that incorporate security, databases, and algorithms. Properly weaving all 
                                        of these concepts together has been something that has taken a while to 
                                        fully understand and complete effectively. Though there are lots of different 
                                        parts, being able to apply them all to make a working program has been one of 
                                        the largest concepts I have learned.</p>
                                    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">By putting together this portfolio, I have been able to examine my previous work,
                                        and see aspects of my projects that excel, as well as fix areas that were lackluster.
                                        Overall, this portfolio has helped me realize the areas that I excel in, making myself
                                        more employable by emphasizing these skills.</p>

                                <h2>About My Projects</h2>
                                    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">The artifacts I have chosen for this portfolio effectively showcase my abilities in 
                                    important areas of programming and development. </p>
                                    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">The course sorting program shows my ability to select proper data structures and 
                                    algorithms for a given situation, as well as my abilities to incorporate such 
                                    structures and algorithms correctly. Additionally, my coding style and ability 
                                    to write readable code excels in this artifact, as the code is very easy to follow 
                                    along. </p>
                                <ul class="actions special">

                                    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">The weight tracking application shows my abilities in software engineering and 
                                    databases. The app requires engineering of XML, Java, and SQLite aspects to make a 
                                    fully functional android application. The app shows my proficiency in each of these 
                                    languages  and my ability to bring them all together. My database skills are shown 
                                    by the architecture of the database, which I personally designed to store all 
                                    necessary data for functionality. My database proficiency is also exhibited by the 
                                    queries that are used to create, read, update, and destroy records in the database</p>
