                            <h2>Overview</h2>
                                <p>This is a C++ program I created for a school project. Using a given
                                    CSV Parser file, I constructed a Binary Search Tree to sort and store
                                    information for College Courses. The tree uses nodes which contain 
                                    defined course objects. The Course objects consist of a name, ID, and
                                    list of prerequisites. The nodes consist of the course object and left,
                                    right, and parent pointers. 
                                </p>
                               
                            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                                <p>The application starts by displaying a menu of choices to the user.
                                    The first option is to load courses. When the user chooses to load
                                    their courses, they are asked to input a file path. If the file is 
                                    successfully opened, the file is iterated through, reading the course
                                    names, IDs, and prerequisites. As each line is read, a course object
                                    is created and inserted into the tree. This process will continue 
                                    until the end of the file is reached.
                                </p>
                            <h3>Inserting Nodes</h3>
                                <p>Each time a node is inserted into the tree, a public insert function is
                                    called and the course is passed as a parameter. The public insert function
                                    first checks if there is a root node to verify if there is a pre-existing
                                    tree. If there is not, a node is created using the parameter course and it 
                                    is assigned as the root. If there is a root, a private AddNode function is
                                    called, passing the root and course as parameter. The private AddNode 
                                    function compares the IDs of the current node and the course being evaluated
                                    to determine if the evaluated ID is less than or greater than the ID of the
                                    ID at the current node. If less than, the function looks left, and if greater
                                    than, the function looks right. In both cases, the current node's pointers are
                                    checked to determine if a node exists at the left or right pointer, depending on
                                    if we are traversing left or right. If the pointer does exist, the function is
                                    recursively called, passing the node of the respective pointer and the course.
                                    If the pointer is null, a new node created with the evaluated course and is 
                                    assigned to the respective pointer.
                                </p>
                            <h2>Using Information</h2>
                            <p>The program has two options for viewing information. One option displays all courses
                                in order by course ID. The other option prompts the user for a Course ID, and displays
                                more information to the user.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Displaying All Courses</h3>
                            <p>If the user selects to view all courses, a public InOrder function is called, which then
                                calls a private InOrder function passing the Root as a parameter. This function recursively 
                                calls itself passing the node to the left, displays the current node's course information,
                                then recursively calls itself passing the node to the right. The recursive pattern will call
                                the function for all nodes in the Tree, and will result in the courses all being displayed
                                in order. The information displayed by this function is only the course's name and ID.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Finding a Specific Course</h3>
                            <p>If the user needs more information regarding a specific course, the third option will prompt 
                                them to input the course's ID. Given the ID, the tree is cycled through starting at the root.
                                The given ID is compared with the current node's ID. If the ID is a match, the node's course's
                                name, ID, and list of prerequisites are displayed. If the given ID is less than that of the
                                current node, the function is recursively called using the node to the left. If greater than, 
                                the function is recursively called using the node to the right. If the function reaches a null
                                pointer, the ID does not exist in the tree, and the function exits, displaying a message to the
                                user that no such course exists.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Starting Again</h3>
                            <p>The final feature of this program is the implementation of a fully functional deconstructor. The
                                user can utilize the deconstructor to completely erase all data in the tree. After the tree is
                                fully deconstructed, the root is assigned as a null pointer. The user can then load different 
                                data. This helps so the user can do everything in one session and helps to free up data no longer
                                being used.
                            </p>
